# Errors
- 1. npx parcel build index.html - give error 
- In package.json we have main:App.js - we are telling that start from here.
- in parcel we give entry point as index.html, so parcel conflicts and hence gives error.

- 2. npm start = npm run start,
- "start" is a reserved keyword and this happens only in case of run start.
- you cannot write npm build, this wont work.

- 3. React.createElement = Object => HTMLElement(Render)
- When we render this Element into DOM, Then it becomes HTML Element.

# JSX 
- JS syntax, easier to create React element
- React and JSX are Different
- We can write React code with JSX
- JSX makes developer's life easy
 
 // const headingjsx = <h1 id"heading"> This is JSX</h1>
- JSX is not HTML inside JS
- JSX is HTML like syntax
- the above code is not valid
- PARCEL TRANSLIES the Js code
- Parcel is doingthe job behind the screen.
- Transpile means converting into a code that Browsers can understand.
- Babel is a library inside Parcel
- Parcel is a manager, inside parcel there is Babel.
- Babel conevrts React code to jsx.
